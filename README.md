# Mobile Price Classification

**Overview**
This project focuses on building classification models to predict the price range (0-3) of mobile phones based on their features in the Mobile Price dataset.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains details of 2000 mobile phones with various features like battery power, RAM, screen size, etc. It has a target variable 'Price_Range' which indicates the price range of the phone.

The 'Price_Range' is a numeric categorical variable with 4 classes:

- 0: Low cost, basic features
- 1: Affordable, moderate features
- 2: Mid-range price, good feature set
- 3: High end, premium models

**Methods**
The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

*Logistic Regression achieved the best accuracy of 95.5% on the test set.*
